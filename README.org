* Strega
Strega is a steganography library written in rust.
** Features
It currently supports png file encoding and decoding.
*** CLI
**** Encoding
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  cargo run encode input-file.png "my top secret text!" -o output-file.png
  # the output file is optional
#+END_SRC

**** Decoding
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  cargo run decode output-file.png 
  "my top secret text!"
  # the output file is optional
#+END_SRC

*** WASM
I tried to add web assembly because it seemed like fun.
#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
  import * as strega from "strega";

  const bytes = new Int8Array([]);
  const encoded_bytes = strega.encode_file(bytes, "my top secret text!", "png");
  strega.decode_file(encoded_bytes, "png");
#+END_SRC

You can find a really stupid web app example in www/ folder.
** Project status
This project is mainly for sperimentation purposes. This is my first
project with the rust programming language, so probably some
implementations could have been done better.
Overall this is not supposed to be a tool that one should use on a
regular basis as there are much better options (at least for now!). However everyone is
welcome to send pull requests.
